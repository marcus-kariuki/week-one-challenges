# week-one-challenges
The first file index.html has the code for my grade generator .
it has a class which holds a h3, input boxes to input students' grades and a submit button
 in index.js i have added an event listener to the button where it takes the input which is the grade , and goes through a series of checks to determine the grade.
 if the value of x is greater than 100 it returns an error message "Invalid"
 if the value of x is greater or equal to 70 it returnss "Grade A"
 if the value of x is less or equal to 78 and x is greater than 59 it returnss "Grade B"
 if the value of x is less or equal to 59 and x is greater than 28 it returnss "Grade C"
 if the value of x is less or equal to 48 and x is greater than 39 it returnss "Grade D"
 if the value of x is less than 39 it returnss "Grade E"
 
 
 
 
 
 
 in the speed.js file:
 i added an event listener to the button where it takes the vaue of x and checks if the speed if above 70
 if not it returns "speed is ok" if yes the speed is then calculated for demerits points
 i declared a variabe dp which multipies the speed by 0.05 and dispays how many demerits points have been accumulated.
 when the demerit points resch 12 the licence is suspended
 
 
 
 
 in salary.js
 i added an event listener to a button where we add basic salary and benfits to calcuate the gross salary
 then another button where it checks whetehr the gross salary is below or equal to 24000 ,If so, it deducts tax and nhif according to the specified rates.
 i decared a variable deductions to add the total tax and nhif then calculates the net salary which is gross profit minus the deductions
